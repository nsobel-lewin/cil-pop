# Gridded Global Population Estimate 
## Product Comparisons
| Dataset | Resolution | Temporal Coverage | Update Frequency | Underlying Inputs | Population Definition | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Gridded Population of the World (GPW), version 4](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4) | 30 arc-seconds | 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020 | Every 5 years or so. The [next](https://sedac.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/769872-when-will-the-new-gpw-be-released) update will be available in late 2024/early 2025. | The 2010 round of Population and Housing Censuses, which occurred between 2005 and 2014. Country-specific inputs are available [here](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/downloads/docs/gpw-v4/gpw-v4-documentation-metadata.xlsx). | Home location |
|[Global Human Settlement Layer â€“ Population (GHS-POP)](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/ghs_pop2023.php) | 100 m, 1 km, 3 arc-seconds, 30 arc-seconds |  1975 to 2030, 5 years intervals | Versions were released in 2022 and 2023, but the EU [describes](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/2ff68a52-5b5b-4a22-8f40-c41da8332cfe) the update frequency as "irregular". | Residential population estimates are derived from the raw global census data from GPW. They are disaggregated from census or administrative units to grid cells, informed by the distribution, classification and volume of built-up areas. More details [here](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/documents/GHSL_Data_Package_2023.pdf?t=1727170839). | Home location |
|[LandScan Global Population database](https://landscan.ornl.gov) | 30 arc-seconds | annual releases 2000 - 2022 | Annual | Estimates are derived using spatial data, high-resolution imagery exploitation, and a multi-variable dasymetric modeling approach to disaggregate census counts within an administrative boundary. Unfortunately, the [description](https://landscan.ornl.gov/about) is not more specific, so it is unclear how the methodology has evolved since [Bright et al. 2014](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/53718546/LandScan2-libre.pdf?1498875002=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DThe_LandScan_Global_Population_Distribut.pdf&Expires=1729116058&Signature=JP44clpgRGdELczdgT6gb-yNDU5eUrjBciooLDk5WXVQDjbj4KWdE3NjOZ6BO2c9tK~XKRGRaJHskCNTWAmK5D9EIMMYVYOU9QTRB6ONJFHeNdIuTsjZ8FfsFHAYToPPYc5i9oOd4A~X6E3UIx4CpoyixKFOiQquYaaVg2Df1YrcEKzbY8opfGgrOWN9EUqwIHIdH6cAg2JJUFY3gIB1aD8cSJyaSR0lqTlbIXpxmULpoFko7q45QMjq0ynbiYvLAQAH6LfLoWqycxcqLQ2r38uTnyaShy0GhmYOEulQTh9~eCI8~N51O5zc3o6eqQ6Ztd4Ead64hZRex20G9AcGgg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA). | Presence |
|[WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org) | 30 arc-seconds | 2000-2020 | WorldPop datasets are updated when new census or geospatial datasets are available. | Sub-national population from GPW and a wide variety of variables for use in dasymetric modeling (see table 1 of [Lloyd et al. 2019](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20964471.2019.1625151#d1e675)). | Home location | |
[Meta High Resolution Population Density Maps](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/high-resolution-population-density-maps) | 30 m | 2020 | No indication | Population estimates are based on data from the GPW data collection and demographic data from Columbia CIESIN. They are disaggregated based on high-resolution image classification of buildings. | Home location | [Seems](https://populationexplorer.org) to be missing a few key countries e.g. Canada, Russia, China. Also does not have the country-specific China dataset [for example](https://data.humdata.org/organization/meta?dataseries_name=Data%20for%20Good%20at%20Meta%20-%20High%20Resolution%20Population%20Density%20Maps%20and%20Demographic%20Estimates&q=China&sort=score%20desc%2C%20last_modified%20desc&ext_page_size=25).


## Validation Checks of Various Products
I have not been able to locate a paper that does a global comparison of products, but there are several papers that compare products for specific geographic regions. 
* [Hall et al. 2012](https://benthamopenarchives.com/abstract.php?ArticleCode=TOGEOGJ-5-1) finds that LandScan performs better than GPW and GRUMP for Swedish data in 2001. 
* [Bustos et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11111-020-00360-8) finds that GHS, LandScan, and WorldPop perform better than GRUMP and GPW for Swedish data from 1990-2015.
* [Xu et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11111-020-00366-2) finds that WorldPop perform better than GPW, GHS, and Landscan in Southwest China in 2015. 
* [Yin et al. 2021](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/10/10/681) finds that LandScan performs better than WorldPop, GHS, and GPW for mainland South East Asia in 2015. LandScan performs particularly well in Thailand and Vietnam, whereas WorldPop performs slightly better in Myanmar and Laos.
